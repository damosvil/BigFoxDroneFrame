# BigFoxDroneFrame
This is a 58 grams 5 inch Floss Light frame to be used with 15x15mm motor mount pattern. All meassures are in millimeters.

The arms of this frame are compatible with FLOSS-210, and FoxDroneFrame frames. They have the same botom plate M3 hole sizes. So you can print only the arms if you want to try the motors setup.

Top plate is 2mm thick, bottom plate is 3mm thick, arms and reinforcements are 4mm thick.

During my tests I tried fiberglass reinforcements, because at a cost of 30% of extraweight they offer better performance in terms of combined resistance to crashes.
